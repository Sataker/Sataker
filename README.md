# Hey, I'm Enzo 👋

**AI Automation Specialist** building intelligent systems that actually work.

I design and deploy **multi-agent AI architectures** — autonomous systems where specialized AI agents collaborate to solve real business problems. Not chatbots. Not wrappers around ChatGPT. Real infrastructure.

## What I Build

🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — 19+ specialized AI agents working together: sales, security, database management, content creation, infrastructure monitoring. Each agent has its own memory, personality, and domain expertise.

⚡ **Business Automation** — AI-powered WhatsApp assistants, automated customer follow-up, intelligent reorder systems, and workflow automation for Brazilian businesses.

🛡️ **Security Testing** — Automated application security assessment through AI agents that browse, test, and report vulnerabilities like a human pentester.

📊 **Data Intelligence** — Automated reporting, sales analytics, and predictive insights for small/medium businesses.
